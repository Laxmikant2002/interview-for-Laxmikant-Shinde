## üìù **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
cd "c:\Users\laxmi\OneDrive\Documents\spacex-launch-dashboard"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: SpaceX Launch Dashboard with React TypeScript"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Create new repository: `interview-for-<your-full-name>`
3. Make it public
4. Don't initialize with README (already exists)

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/interview-for-<your-full-name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/spacex
git push -u origin feat/spacex
```

### Step 5: Deploy Application

**Option A - Vercel (Recommended)**:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

**Option B - Netlify**:

1. Build project: `npm run build`
2. Drag `build` folder to netlify.com
3. Get deployment URL

### Step 6: Create Pull Request

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Create PR: `feat/spacex` ‚Üí `main`
3. Add title: "SpaceX Launch Dashboard Implementation"
4. Add description with deployment URL
5. Add reviewers: `abbasali1994`, `rhymes17`
6. Mark as "Ready for review"
7. Comment: "The application is ready for the code review."
