## ðŸš¨ **URGENT: Challenge Submission Steps**

### **Required for SpaceX Dashboard Challenge Completion**

Before using the general sharing methods below, you MUST complete these steps for the interview challenge:

#### 1. **Initialize Git Repository**

```bash
cd "c:\Users\laxmi\OneDrive\Documents\spacex-launch-dashboard"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: SpaceX Launch Dashboard with React TypeScript"
```

#### 2. **Create GitHub Repository**

- Repository name: `interview-for-<your-full-name>` (replace with your actual name)
- Make it PUBLIC
- Do NOT initialize with README

#### 3. **Push to GitHub**

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/interview-for-<your-full-name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
git checkout -b feat/spacex
git push -u origin feat/spacex
```

#### 4. **Deploy Immediately**

```bash
# Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
npm install -g vercel
npm run build
vercel --prod

# Option 2: Netlify
npm run build
# Then drag 'build' folder to netlify.com
```

#### 5. **Create Pull Request**

- Create PR: `feat/spacex` â†’ `main`
- Add reviewers: `abbasali1994`, `rhymes17`
- Add deployment URL in comments
- Mark as "Ready for review"
- Comment: "The application is ready for the code review."

## How to Share Your SpaceX Dashboard Design

### 1. **Browser Screenshots**

Since your dashboard is now running at http://localhost:3000, you can capture high-quality screenshots:

**For Windows (using built-in tools):**

- Press `Windows + Shift + S` for Snipping Tool
- Or use `Windows + PrtScn` for full screen
- Use browser dev tools (F12) to test different screen sizes

**For Professional Screenshots:**

- Use browser dev tools â†’ Device Mode â†’ Select different devices
- Capture desktop, tablet, and mobile views
- Take screenshots of different states (loading, filtered, modal open)

### 2. **Figma-Style Documentation**

Create a presentation showing:

- Overall dashboard view
- Filter interactions
- Table with different status indicators
- Modal detail view
- Mobile responsive layout

### 3. **Interactive Demo**

Your live application serves as an interactive prototype:

- Share localhost link during live presentations
- Deploy to hosting service for permanent sharing
- Record screen interactions for animated demos

### 4. **Design Comparison**

Document how your implementation matches Figma specifications:

- Side-by-side comparisons
- Color palette documentation
- Typography choices
- Layout measurements

## Quick Deployment for Sharing
